This repository contains my work done during my web scraping internship.

I used Python to collect data from websites using tools like Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.

The project helped me understand how websites work, how to parse HTML, and how to extract required data from web pages.

This repository is created for learning and internship purposes.
